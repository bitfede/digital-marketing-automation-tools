# Affiliate Marketing / Media Buying Automation Tools

These python scripts are useful automation tools that can be used when running digital ads.

So far I made:

- an autoblocker for Go2Mobi

- an autobidder for ZeroPark [abandoned, no longer using ZP]

- an afflow live lead data listener

- an autoblock for Go2Mobi

- a script to pull down offer from Mobidea

- a few tools for propellerAds: autoblocker, ? , ?. [currently work in progress]

Thanks for checking it out!

Best,
Federico.
